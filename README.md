# Revizrlearn

My main project, named Revizrlearn, is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that was developed to address the needs of HSC students that sought for an effective revision tool. The solution I determined aims to meet the continuous demands for self-directed learning with the support of active recall sources. Despite initially being designed with senior secondary students in mind, Revizrlearnâ€™s features allow it to be used by the general public that can be catered to their individual preferences.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

If your project uses any dependencies, install them using:

```bash
npm install
```
*(Skip this step if you don't have a package.json or dependencies.)*

### 2. Start the Server

To run the backend server, open your terminal and type:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start your server on the port specified in your `server.js` file (commonly port 3000 or 5000).

### 3. Open the Project in Your Browser

There are a couple of ways to open the frontend page:

#### Option 1: Using Live Server (VS Code Extension)
1. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code if you haven't already.
2. Right-click on your main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in the file explorer.
3. Select **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. Your default browser should open and display the page.

#### Option 2: Opening the HTML File Directly
1. Locate your main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in your project directory.
2. Double-click the file to open it in your default web browser.

#### Option 3: Visit the Localhost Address
- If your server runs a frontend (e.g., serves static files), open your browser and go to:
  ```
  http://localhost:3000
  ```
  *(Replace 3000 with your actual server port if different.)*

## Other Notes

- Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/).
- If you make changes to your code, refresh your browser to see the updates.
- If you encounter any issues, check the terminal for error messages.
